# Discord Bot Migration: Local Files → Discord URL Storage

## Overview
Successfully migrated the Instagram-style Discord bot from local file storage to using Discord's CDN for image hosting. This solves the Render.com free tier storage limitations.

## What Changed

### 1. Database Schema
- The `filename` column in the `images` table now stores Discord attachment URLs instead of local filenames
- No schema migration needed - existing data structure remains the same

### 2. Image Processing (`utils/imageProcessor.js`)
- **Updated**: `createInstagramCard()` now accepts `imageUrl` parameter instead of `imagePath`
- **Updated**: `createRoundedRectangleImage()` now downloads images from URLs using the `downloadImage()` method
- **Added**: `uploadToDiscordStorage()` - uploads images to a designated Discord channel and returns permanent URLs
- **Added**: `validateImageAttachment()` - validates images without downloading them first
- **Removed**: Local file methods (`saveImage`, `processUploadedImage`, `deleteImageFile`, `getImagePath`, `imageExists`)
- **Removed**: `createCircularAvatar()` method (no longer needed)

### 3. Upload Command (`commands/upload.js`)
- Now uses `imageProcessor.uploadToDiscordStorage()` to upload images to Discord
- Stores Discord URLs in database instead of local filenames
- Removed duplicate validation code (now uses centralized validation)

### 4. Profile Display (`commands/profile.js`)
- Updated `showImageCard()` to use Discord URLs instead of file paths
- Removed file existence checks since Discord handles the storage

### 5. Delete Command (`commands/deleteimage.js`)
- Removed physical file deletion since Discord CDN handles storage
- Only removes database entries now

### 6. Button Handlers (`events/interactionCreate.js`)
- Updated navigation and like handlers to use Discord URLs
- Removed file existence checks

## Benefits of This Migration

✅ **Persistent Storage**: Images survive bot restarts and hosting service reboots
✅ **Zero Storage Costs**: Uses Discord's CDN instead of hosting provider storage
✅ **Better Reliability**: Discord's CDN is highly available and fast
✅ **Simplified Code**: No local file management needed
✅ **Render.com Compatible**: Works perfectly with ephemeral storage limitations

## Required Configuration

Make sure to set the `DATABASE_CHANNEL_ID` environment variable to a Discord channel where the bot can store images. This should be a private channel that users cannot access directly.

## Image Flow

1. User uploads image via `/upload` command
2. Bot validates the attachment
3. Bot sends image to database channel to get permanent Discord URL
4. Bot stores Discord URL in SQLite database
5. When displaying profiles, bot fetches images directly from Discord URLs
6. All image processing (rounded corners, card generation) happens in-memory using URLs

No local files are created or stored anymore!
